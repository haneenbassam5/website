              <h2>History Of Store</h2>
             
              <p> Neon, marketed as NEON until 2020, is a subscription video on demand service offering a range of television shows and movies.
                 The platform is a division of Sky Network Television Limited.</p>
           
             
                   <p>In 11 June, Neon experienced technical difficulties that caused users to be locked out of the app.[13] In mid-June 2020, Sky announced that Lightbox would be merged into Neon, 
                    with Lightbox app being replaced by a Neon app on 7 July 2020. The merged service retained the Neon brand but continues to use Lightbox's interface and incorporates content drawn from both Neon and the old Lightbox. 
                    Existing Spark customers can receive a NZ$9.95 discount.</p>
